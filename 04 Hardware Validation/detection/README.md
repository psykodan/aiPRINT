Accuracy testing follows similar proceedure as data generation.
The gcode has known areas of over/under extrusion.
The operator presses a key to indicate when these areas are being printed live.
The expected classification and actual classification are recorded.

Speed testing involves sending as many images as possible in 100 seconds to tensoflow model.
THe time to classify and number of detections processed is recorded.
